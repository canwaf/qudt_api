# Original Requirements

TODO: More hilarious hallucinations from MetaGPT, I'll rewrite this later.

Write a python flask API which extends base QUDT units using URL queries to add scaling_factor and labels, returning RDF responses of the new units.

## Product Goals

- Create a user-friendly API
- Ensure accurate conversion and scaling of QUDT units
- Provide RDF responses for easy integration with other systems

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to easily scale QUDT units using URL queries so that I can quickly implement unit conversions in my application.
- As a data scientist, I want to receive RDF responses so that I can easily integrate the data with my existing systems.
- As a user, I want to add labels to the units so that I can easily identify and categorize them.
- As a system administrator, I want the API to be built using Python Flask so that it aligns with our existing tech stack.
- As a product manager, I want the API to extend base QUDT units so that we can cover a wide range of unit conversions.

## Competitive Analysis

- Competitor A: Provides similar functionality but does not support RDF responses.
- Competitor B: Supports RDF responses but does not allow scaling through URL queries.
- Competitor C: Allows scaling and provides RDF responses but does not support adding labels.
- Competitor D: Supports all required features but is not built using Python Flask.
- Competitor E: Provides a similar API but lacks in performance and scalability.
- Competitor F: Has a user-friendly API but does not extend base QUDT units.
- Competitor G: Extends base QUDT units but lacks in providing a user-friendly API.

## Requirement Analysis

The product needs to be a Python Flask API that can extend base QUDT units. It should allow users to add a scaling factor and labels through URL queries. The API should return RDF responses of the new units.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Create a Python Flask API']
- ['P0', 'Extend base QUDT units']
- ['P1', 'Add scaling factor and labels through URL queries']
- ['P1', 'Return RDF responses of the new units']

## UI Design draft

As this is an API, there is no user interface. However, the API endpoints should be clearly documented with examples of how to add the scaling factor and labels through URL queries.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific RDF format for the responses needs to be clarified. Additionally, the range of base QUDT units to be supported by the API needs to be specified.
